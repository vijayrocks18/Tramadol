        <h2 class="">Medical uses</h2>
      <p >Tramadol is used primarily to treat mild to severe pain, both acute and chronic.[20][21] There is moderate evidence for use as a second-line treatment for fibromyalgia but it is not FDA approved for this use.[22] Its use is approved for treatment of fibromyalgia as a secondary painkiller by the NHS.[23</p>
      <p> Its analgesic effects take approximately an hour to be realized, and it takes from two to four hours to reach peak effect after oral administration with an immediate-release formulation.[20][21] On a dose-by-dose basis, tramadol has about one-tenth the potency of morphine (thus 100 mg is commensurate with 10 mg morphine but may vary) and is practically equally potent when compared with pethidine and codeine.[24] For pain moderate in severity, its effectiveness is roughly equivalent to that of codeine in low doses and hydrocodone at very high doses. For severe pain it is less effective than morphine.[20] <br> Pain reducing effects last approximately six hours. The potency of analgesia varies considerably as it depends on an individual's genetics. People with specific variants of CYP2D6 enzymes may not produce adequate amounts of the active metabolite (desmetramadol) for effective pain control.[12][20]</p>

            <h2>Side effects</h2>
            <p>The most common adverse effects of tramadol include nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, indigestion, abdominal pain, vertigo, vomiting, constipation, drowsiness, and headache.[33][34] Other side effects may result from interactions with other medications. Tramadol has the same dose-dependent adverse effects as morphine including respiratory depression.[35]</p>
            <p>Long-term use of high doses of tramadol causes physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome.[36] These include both symptoms typical of opioid withdrawal and those associated with serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) withdrawal; symptoms include numbness, tingling, paresthesia, and tinnitus.[37] Psychiatric symptoms may include hallucinations, paranoia, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, and confusion.[38] In most cases, tramadol withdrawal will set in 12–20 hours after the last dose, but this can vary.[37] Tramadol withdrawal typically lasts longer than that of other opioids. Seven days or more of acute withdrawal symptoms can occur as opposed to typically 3 or 4 days for other codeine analogues.[37]</p>

            <h2>Overdose</h2>
            <p>The clinical presentation in overdose cases can vary but typically includes neurological, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal manifestations.[39][40] The predominant neurological symptoms are seizures and altered levels of consciousness, ranging from somnolence to coma. Seizures are particularly notable due to Tramadol's lowering of the seizure threshold, occurring in approximately half of acute poisoning cases.[41] Patients often exhibit tachycardia and mild hypertension. Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting are common, and agitation, anxiety, and cold and clammy skin may also be present.[42]</p>
            <p>While less common, severe complications like respiratory depression and serotonin syndrome can occur, particularly in polydrug overdoses involving other CNS depressants (such as Benzodiazepines, Opioids, and Alcohol) and agents with serotonergic activity.[43][44] Additionally, Individuals with genetic variations leading to CYP2D6 enzyme duplication (rapid metabolizers) may have an increased risk of adverse effects, due to faster conversion of Tramadol to its active metabolite.[45]

                Acute Tramadol overdose is generally not life-threatening, with most fatalities resulting from polysubstance overdose.[46] Management includes cardiovascular monitoring, activated charcoal administration, hydration, and treatment of seizures.[47] Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can partially reverse some effects of Tramadol overdose, particularly respiratory depression. However, its use may increase the risk of seizures due to unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation.[20] For suspected serotonin syndrome, cyproheptadine, a serotonin antagonist, is considered an effective antidote.[43]</p>
